This dataset, titled "Student Academic Performance with Physiological and Behavioral Indicators," consists of 1,000 samples, each representing a reading related to student performance in an academic context at **ABC Institute of Higher Education**, a mid-sized academic institution specializing in science and technology. The institute has a strong focus on tracking student progress and well-being using both quantitative and qualitative measures.

The dataset includes physiological measurements such as **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)**, **Skin Conductance (SC)**, and **Brain Activity**, which are indicative of stress, cognitive load, and focus during the task. Additionally, behavioral data like **Eye Movement**, **Physical Activity**, and **Facial Expression** are captured to gauge engagement and attention.

Each sample is linked to a specific **Student Profile**, which includes a **Student_ID** (ranging from 1 to 10), representing a diverse set of students enrolled in the institute's advanced courses. The dataset also includes demographic information like **age group** (18-25 years) and **gender**, though these details are anonymized for privacy. Additionally, self-reported questionnaire responses on **Attention**, **Distractibility**, **Engagement**, and **Motivation**, scaled from 1 to 5, are collected along with environmental factors like **Distractions**.

The **academic_performance** target variable is classified into four categories (0 to 3), representing varying levels of student performance. Each sample includes a **Date_of_Reading** in timestamp format, making it possible to track individual performance across time. The dataset is structured to support research into how physiological, emotional, and environmental factors correlate with academic success at the institutional level.
